# Laravel Project Hub

This is a very simple base installation of Laravel with a few things pre configured.

AdminLTE theme.
Auth via cartalyst/sentinel
Twig support via [rcrow/TwigBridge](https://github.com/rcrowe/TwigBridge)  ( I like Twig better than Blade )
Basic user management

Just clone the repository and set up like you would set up any Laravel installation ( setup your .env, run migrations, composer install, setup your web server )

There are no users at the start, the first time you try to login, it will take the username and password you try to login with and create a first user based on that.
